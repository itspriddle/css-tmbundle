# Folding Groups for TextMate's CSS Bundle

This repo contains a tmDelta file that adds folding support for CSSEdit groups.

CSSEdit allows groups to be created as follows:

    /* @group My Group */

    .. some css

    /* @end */

The tmDelta file in this repo adjusts TextMate's CSS folding markers so you
can fold groups.


## Installation

    cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/TextMate/Bundles/`.
    git clone git://github.com/itspriddle/css-tmbundle.git CSS.tmbundle
